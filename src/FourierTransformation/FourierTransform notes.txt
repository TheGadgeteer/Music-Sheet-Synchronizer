Real DFT:
	Takes a N point time domain signal
	Outputs Frequency Domain:
		N/2 + 1 point Real Part: contains cosinus amplitudes (ampl = Value / N/2 )
		N/2 + 1 point Imaginary Part: contains sinus amplitudes (ampl = Value / N/2 )
Complex DFT:
	Time Domain signal, consisting of
		N point Real Part
		N point Imaginary Part
	Outputs Frequency Domain:
		N point Real Part
		N point Imaginary Part
	Consistencies with Real DFT:
		Set Imaginary Part values to zero
		in Frequency Domain, Real and Imaginary Part values from idx 0 to N/2 are the same
		Frequency Domain:
			Real Part from idx N/2 + 1 to N-1 contains mirror of values 0 to N/2 (ReX[N/2 + 1] = ReX[N/2 - 1] and so on)
			Imaginary Part  from idx N/2 + 1 to N-1 contains mirror of values 0 to N/2 (ReX[N/2 + 1] = - ReX[N/2 - 1] and so on)
